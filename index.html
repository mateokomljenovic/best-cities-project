			<h2>How to get here</h2>
			<p><strong>Plane: </strong>If you're looking to travel far away, your best option is to check the cheap flights. There are numerous apps for finding affordable flights. One of them is <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/">Skyscanner</a> which I use the most.</p>
			<p><strong>Train: </strong>If you're looking for a shorter relation trip, you could check out country railroads websites. Usually going with train means an adventure. You get to see a lot of landscape that you'll definitelly miss with plane or driving in a car.</p>
			<p><strong>Car: </strong>Maybe not the cheapest, but most mobile option is your own car. You can always check things on your itinerary and not worry how much time do you got to enjoy in the moment. Only downside are traffic jams.</p>

    	<h2>Buses and Trams</h2>
	    	<p>Bus is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers.The most common type of bus is the single-deck bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services.</p>

    	<h2>Skylines and urban areas</h2>
	    	<p>An urban area or urban agglomeration is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.</p> 
	    	<p>Each of them will offer you a unique skyline as well as vastly different urban areas. No matter which one you will choose, you will have a lot to show to your friends on social media.</p>
